This repository serves as a template for creating high-quality Terraform modules for AWS resources.

It follows the standard module structure recommended by HashiCorp and includes all the necessary requirements for publishing a module.
In addition, this module includes features such as version pinning and automated testing to ensure the reliability and quality of the code.

Please note that this module is intended to be used as a starting point for creating new repositories and is not a useful module by itself.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps.

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

















## Quick Start

1. Create a new repository and check out the branch you want to work on.
2. Replace the Terraform code at the root of the repository with the code you want to publish.
3. Update the code in the examples/complete directory to include Terraform code that will make a good automated test. Please keep the context.tf and fixtures.us-east-2.tfvars files in place and only change the name, leaving the region, namespace, environment, and stage as is.
4. Update the test/src/examples_complete_test.go file to verify the outputs of running terraform apply on the examples/complete directory.
5. Run make github/init to update the repository with the current Cloud Posse framework files (e.g. CODEOWNERS).
6. Run make pr/auto-format to format the Terraform code and generate documentation.
7. Commit all changes to git and open a pull request on the new repository.
